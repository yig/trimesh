trimesh.py:
    A python half-edge data structure for a triangle mesh that can
        - handle boundaries (the first outgoing halfedge at a vertex is always a boundary halfedge)
          (and the last outgoing halfedge is always the opposite of a boundary halfedge))
        - save/load itself to/from OBJ format
        - save itself to OFF format

    Loading:
        import trimesh
        mesh = trimesh.TriMesh.FromOBJ_FileName( "cube.obj" )

trimesh_viewer.py:
    A very simple GLUT viewer for TriMesh objects.
    Keys are:
        - w: toggle edges (wireframe)
        - r: reset the view
        - c: captures current window backbuffer into "screen-capture-<title>-<number>.png"
        - \: toggle fullscreen
        - q: quit

GLUTWindow.py:
    A very simple class wrapping GLUT.
    Keys are:
        - c: captures current window backbuffer into "screen-capture-<title>-<number>.png"
        - \: toggle fullscreen
        - q: quit

Known issues:
    trimesh.TriMesh doesn't save or load normals.
    trimesh.TriMesh doesn't load texture coordinates (though it does save them).
    GLUTWindow.GLUTWindow screen capture is broken and needs to be changed to use PIL.
